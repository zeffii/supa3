super collider 3 snippets and projects. i am going to learn this stuff properly. this repo will host the code for my ramblings at http://supa3.tumblr.com/
the whole reason i started getting interested in code was to create musical machine for buzz tracker, but coding soon became more interesting and deep than music creation 
. 

now when i attempt to write music in my regular tracker 'buze' (and more recently renoise) i can't help but feel the restriction of 
the environment. sure buze has armstrong bindings for python and delivered some fun, but it wasn't realtime. i kinda need realtime thesedays.

So this supercollider stuff seems like an interesting language to learn, a bit like smalltalk but with syntax similar to C and groovy. there's a lot i don't know yet
so i'll stop now and dig on. 

initially i will follow along with the book: http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/275/CottleSC3.pdf but won't place direct answers to exercises
here. you will likely find derived routines and explorations from all over (youtube, vimeo, github..etc)

enjoy these snippets and projects, as i hope i do.
