it's going to happen, i _am_ going to learn super collider 3 properly. this repo will host code for ramblings found at http://supa3.tumblr.com/
the whole reason i started getting interested in code was to create musical machines for buzz tracker, but coding soon became interesting in its own right. 
learning to code and enjoy it is a profoundly zen experience. 

now when i attempt to write music in my regular tracker 'buze' (and more recently renoise) i can't help but feel the restriction of 
the environment. sure buze has armstrong bindings for python and has delivered some fun, but it wasn't realtime. i kinda need realtime thesedays.

So this supercollider stuff seems like an interesting language to learn, a bit like smalltalk but with syntax similar to C and groovy. there's a lot i don't know yet
so i'll stop now and dig on. 

initially i will follow along with the book: http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/275/CottleSC3.pdf but won't place direct answers to exercises
here. you will likely find derived routines and explorations from all over (youtube, vimeo, github..etc)

enjoy these snippets and projects, as i hope i do.
